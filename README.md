## This is my portfolio website

A project in which I am able to promote myself and my skills on a single page.

This was all done with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript and designed to be simple and minimal to avoid too much reading and getting to my skills and projects quickly. 3 showcase projects are available which link to their respective respositories and user is encouraged to look at my Github page for more projects.

This is also the first time I put as much effort into design and as a result learnt more about CSS and animations.
