                    During my journey as a developer, I have gained constant urge to learn and progress in many areas.

                <p>

                    Being from a Computer Science background, I enjoy programming. But I also enjoy weight lifting, 
                    long distance running and reading. I am currently skilled at Front-end development using Angular, 
                    however I have been sharpening my skills with React as I find that framework fun to use. Itching to learn, 
                    I am investing as much time as I can at being skilled in Back-end development and other areas of Software 
                    Engineering and Computer Science while making sure I finish the book I’m reading or 100% the video game I’m in the middle of.
